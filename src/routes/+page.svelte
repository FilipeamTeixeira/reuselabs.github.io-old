				Data is often expensive, heterogeneous and incomplete.
				Our method collects freely available data (e.g. OpenStreetMaps) and validates it
				through traditional spatial statistics, in order to achieve a transparent and clear
				dataset building the right foundations to create data.

				<p class ="uk-light uk-text-justify uk-margin-medium-left" style = "font-family:Helvetica; font-weight:100;">
				Cleaning heterogeneous, complex, and incomplete datasets, is often expensive
				both for the time needed to process the data, as for the data storage infrastructure required 
				to be in place. We use easy to implement and to manage solutions (e.g ElasticSearch)
				which assure scalability and increase the readability of your data.

					Following your experience in neurosciences, user experience, design, research and product design,
					we design dynamic, ready to use, data visualisations, allowing a better understanding of your

				The StationsRadar tool was developed in the context of recently completed doctoral research (December 2019) at Ghent University and Vrije Universiteit Brussel (funded by the Research Foundation).
				This research, conducted by Freke Caset and entitled "Planning for Nodes, Places, and People: A Strategic Railway Station Development Tool for Flanders".
				Freke was responsible for the data collection and processing process and for the conceptual development of the radar charts.
				Furthermore, the intensive cooperation of UGent colleague and doctoral researcher Filipe Teixeira was crucial in the development of this tool.
				Filipe programmed the tool and designed the website and the graphics. The doctoral research and development of the tool were supervised by Ben Derudder and Frank Witlox (UGent) and Kobe Boussauw (VUB).
				The reasoning underlying the radar diagrams is based on a long tradition of 'node-place models': a methodology that is mainly applied in the Dutch context to this day.
				Within this node-location approach, the accessibility of a station environment is not only viewed from a purely transport-technical angle (the node value of a station),
				but the spatial context in which the station functions (the place value) is also explicitly included. In addition to aspects of 'node' and 'place', characteristics of the station users were also included in this study.

				ReUSe stands for, Readable Usable Science. We believe that most methodologies nowadays such as complex, blackbox,
				AI methods, do not allow an easy understanding of your data, making science and data communication difficult to non technical audiences.
				At ReUSe labs, we go further than data cleaning. We build usable data structures, while giving you complete control of data.
